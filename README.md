I'm a software developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and PHP. I am happy to learn about new technology and also working as software developer in [vertilogic.com](https://vertilogic.com).
I also have a team called digitaltech.id that helps people grow up their business. Making a website, mobile apps, and even IT consultant.
